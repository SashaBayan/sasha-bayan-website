        This album isn't just a collection of songsâ€”it's a narrative journey of
        11 tracks that investigates intimate questions of enoughness in love and
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceived and nurtured over a period of two years, the album "enough" is
        Sasha Bayan's latest project, reflecting a musical journey reminiscent
        of the works of artists like Sufjan Stevens and Andrew Bird.
