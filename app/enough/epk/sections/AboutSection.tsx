    <p className="mb-4">
      This album isn't just a collection of songsâ€”it's a narrative journey of 11
      tracks that investigates intimate questions of enoughness in love and
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceived and nurtured over a period of two years, the album "enough" is
      Sasha Bayan's latest project, reflecting a musical journey reminiscent of
      artists like Sufjan Stevens and Andrew Bird.
